In this game, you can peacefully live alongside mysterious creatures known as Pals or risk your life to drive off a ruthless poaching syndicate.\nPals can be used to fight, or they can be made to work on farms or factories.\nYou can even sell them or eat them!\nSurvival\nIn a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes.\nMounts & Exploration\nPals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky\u2014allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world.\nBuilding Structures\nWant to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. Don't worry; there are no labor laws for Pals.\nProduction\nMake use of Pals and their skills to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort.\nFarming\nSome Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead.\nFactories & Automation\nLetting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fed\u2014until they're dead, that is.\nDungeon Exploration\nWith Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect your life\u2014even if it costs their own.\nBreeding & Genetics\nBreed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents. Combine rare pals to create the strongest Pal of them all!\nPoaching & Crime\nEndangered Pals live in wildlife sanctuaries. Sneak in and capture rare Pals to get rich quick! It's not a crime if you don't get caught, after all.\nMultiplayer\nMultiplayer is supported, so invite a friend and go on an adventure together! And of course you can battle your friends and trade Pals, too.\nIn online co-op play mode, up to 4 players can play together.\nAdditionally, a dedicated server can allow up to 32 players to play together.",

Do whatever it takes to last another night.\nRust is in its 10th year and has now had over 375 content updates, with a guaranteed content patch every month. From regular balance fixes and improvements to AI and graphics updates to adding content like new maps, musical instruments, trains and drones, as well as regular seasons and events, there\u2019s always something interesting or dangerous (or both) happening on the island. Updates to the game include:\nProcedurally generated worlds with map editor support\nHost your own servers and with server-side modding support\nVehicles: horses, modular cars, hot air balloons, helicopters, trains, boats and more\nComplex electrical and automation systems \nFarming\nNew enemies, wildlife and factions\nNew monuments and areas to explore\nGestures and contact system\nMusical instruments\nLarge train network\nHuge recent graphics overhaul\n..and more\nEXPLORE\nYou wake naked on a mysterious island armed only with a rock and a torch. You\u2019ll need to brave natural dangers (from heat and cold to thirst and starvation), build a shelter, eat (or be eaten), scavenge materials. Explore the island, its abandoned settlements, mysterious monuments and the factions that occupy them. But, above all, watch out for other survivors...\nBUILD\nDesign and build bases to defend your territory or control the resources of the island. Research the tech tree, grow farms, command electricity, commandeer vehicles from horses to cars to boats to helicopters. Whatever it takes to get ahead.\nSURVIVE\nThere are no rules in Rust but the ones you make for yourself. Craft tools, armor and weapons to defend yourself. Cooperate with friends and allies and build a town together. Explore the island and what\u2019s happening in it. Trade with other players. Or prey on them, raiding their bases and taking their hard-won goods.\nFor parental controls, please see Steam Family View: \nhttps://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6B1A-66BE-E911-3D98",

You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up \u2013 not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits\u2026 step through the looking-glass and join it!\nARK: Genesis Part Two!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-VLZjsXWuM\nYour quest for ultimate survival is now complete with the launch of ARK: Genesis Part 2! Survivors will conclude the ARK storyline while adventuring through exotic new worlds with all-new mission-based gameplay. Discover, utilize and master new creatures, new craftable items, weapons, and structures unlike anything you have seen yet! The saga is now complete, and hundreds of hours of new story-oriented ARK gameplay await you!\nPurchased as part of the ARK: Genesis Season Pass you gain access to two new huge story-oriented expansion packs -- Genesis Part 1 and Genesis Part 2 (new!) -- as well as a 'Noglin' Chibi cosmetic, a \u2018Shadowmane\u2019 Chibi cosmetic, a new cosmetic armor set, and an in-game, artificially intelligent companion called \u2018HLN-A\u2019 who can scan additional hidden Explorer Notes found throughout the other ARKs. \nFeatures the voiceover talent of David Tennant (Doctor Who, Good Omens) playing the villainous Sir Edmund Rockwell, and Madeleine Madden (The Wheel of Time, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Dora and the Lost City of Gold) as in-game robotic AI companion HLN-A/Helena Walker.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1113410/ARK_Genesis_Season_Pass/\nAbout the Game\nAs a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!\nDinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you\u2019ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!\nYou must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!\n By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\nPick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!\nBy bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK\u2019s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.\nCreate a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!\nAll items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new \"Engrams\" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D \"Explorer Notes\". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!\nEverything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!\nThe mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you\u2019ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.\nOn the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.\nYou can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!\nThe over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) & true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

        "description": "PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree. \nThe CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands?\nUp to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear.\nKey Features\nRob Banks, Get Paid \u2013 Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.\nCRIMENET \u2013 The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician \"The Elephant\", and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind.\nPAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level \u2013 Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good.\nDynamic Scenarios \u2013 No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events.\nChoose Your Skills \u2013 As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister.\nMore Masks than Ever \u2013 PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations.  \nWeapons and Modifications \u2013 A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine?\nPlay It Your Way \u2013 Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience.\nA Long History of Additional Content \u2013 More than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts.",

        "description": "You are an Exile, struggling to survive on the dark continent of Wraeclast, as you fight to earn power that will allow you to exact your revenge against those who wronged you. Created by hardcore gamers, Path of Exile is an online Action RPG set in a dark fantasy world. With a focus on visceral action combat, powerful items and deep character customization, Path of Exile is completely free and will never be pay-to-win.\nKey Features\nFreedom. Power. Revenge.\nPath of Exile is an online Action RPG designed around a strong online item economy and deep character customisation. \nPath of Exile is set in the dark fantasy world of Wraeclast. Scarred by mysterious catastrophes of the past and inhabited by creatures of nightmare, the very environment challenges exiles who dare explore it. You play as the Duelist, Witch, Ranger, Templar, Marauder, Shadow or the Scion class. From forsaken shores through to the city of Oriath, explore Wraeclast and uncover the ancient secrets waiting for you.\nUnlimited Character Customization\nCreate and customise hundreds of unique skill combinations from tradable itemised gems and our gigantic Passive Skill Tree. Combine skill gems, support gems and trigger gems to create your own unique combination of power, defence and destruction.\nAll of Path of Exile's character classes share its vast Passive Skill Tree. Starting at one of seven distinct locations dictated by their chosen class, players can focus on the core specialities of their class or travel across the tree to build complex combinations of skills from various disciplines. Scattered across the tree are Keystone passives, Masteries and Jewel Sockets that drastically alter the way a character is played. \nArmed to Kill\nPath of Exile is completely designed around items. Our flasks are persistent items that have mods. Our endgame areas can be found as Map items that have mods altering their challenges and rewards. We've gone as far as removing gold as a currency and basing our trade economy around orbs that can randomly reroll the properties of other items. We have carefully constructed our item system for veterans of the best Action RPGs.\nExplore the Atlas of Worlds\nThe Atlas of Worlds is a series of more than a hundred high-level maps that truly test the limits of your build. As you explore the Atlas, you will eventually unveil its dark secrets and face the most dangerous bosses that Wraeclast has ever seen.\nIn the true Path of Exile way, the Atlas of Worlds has its own Passive Skill Tree. Earn skill points for the Tree by completing maps on the Atlas and create your own unique endgame experience.\nDeadly Missions\nIn your journey through Wraeclast, you will meet fellow Exiles who seek your help. Capture wild beasts for Einhar, delve into the depths of the Azurite Mine with Niko, explore the secrets of the Temple of Atzoatl with Alva or investigate a mysterious Immortal Syndicate with Jun. Once received, these missions can be completed at any time in the endgame. This optional content in Path of Exile will reward you with valuable currency, powerful tradeable items and new ways of crafting.\nCustomise Your Hideout\n\u200bIn your extensive travels throughout the Acts and the Atlas of Worlds, you will discover secret locations swarmed with dangerous monsters. Defeat them, claim the Hideout for yourself and create your own personalised town. Use your Hideout as a quiet place to trade with other Exiles, craft after battle, or expand it and use it as a personalised Guild Hall with hundreds of decorations.\nBe Ruthless\nRuthless is an optional game mode which offers a more challenging way to play Path of Exile. Ruthless players can expect extreme item scarcity, limited crafting and many other changes such as support gems being drop-only. Ruthless is a mode about friction, tension and anticipation. It's much more difficult, but overcoming that difficulty feels highly rewarding. In a world where your items are far below par, every item drop has the potential to be the breakthrough one you need.\nFair-To-Play. Never Pay-To-Win. \nWe're committed to creating a fair playing field for all players. All Microtransactions in Path of Exile are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay.",

Teams of 5 face off in a variety of modes from pushing a payload to contesting rotating objectives. \nOur roster of over 50 Champions is the largest in the genre, with various archetypes for players to learn and master. Between the versatile and lethal Damage class, the aggressive and elusive Flank class, the sturdy and space-making Frontline class, and the healing and buff managing Support class; there is a Champion that matches every player's expression. Each Champion allows you to customize and augment their abilities out of match & itemize in-game to play exactly how you want them to.\nCustomization reigns supreme even beyond your gameplay, from the ability to show off your profile to unique Champion skins that alter their presentation and voices, to even effects after you eliminate opponents or fall in battle. Cosmetics explore themes from across the Realm and beyond, meaning your version of a Champion not only plays unique, but looks it too!",

And if there isn\u2019t, we\u2019ll give you the tools to make your dream a reality.\nWhile not required to join in on the fun, VRChat was built to take advantage of VR headsets in many unique ways. That means avatars that flow with your movement, and systems that work alongside various hardware platforms to provide full-body tracking, finger tracking, and much, much more.\nThere\u2019s something magical around every corner. Come take a look, and see what you find.\nIn VRChat, there\u2019s always something to do \u2013 and people to meet there.\nVisit a planetarium and have a chat about astronomy. Go on a virtual hike through a majestic fantasy forest. Pull up to a car meet, and talk shop with some gearheads. Attend a live music event underneath a chemical storage facility, and talk obscure genres with DJs. Once you find your crowd, join their Group, and you'll be able to find them again the next time you're on.\nYour community \u2013 \nwhatever it is\n \u2013 is here.\nThere are thousands of games to play in VRChat. Try running a kitchen in a busy restaurant, or racing go-karts in zero gravity. Fancy a battle royale? We\u2019ve got those, too -- just probably with a wider diversity of avatars than you\u2019ve ever seen before.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what you like to play: casual card games, shooters, racing, platformers, puzzles, horror, and of course, endless party games. If you want to play it, it probably exists here (and if it doesn't, you can build it yourself).\nEverything here was built by the community using the VRChat SDK. Combined with Unity and Udon, our in-house scripting language, we give our users as much power as possible to build whatever their imaginations can conjure up.\nBut creation isn\u2019t just limited to worlds.\nVRChat provides a level of creative freedom that is unmatched anywhere else, and nowhere is that reflected best than on the avatars of our users. In VRChat, you can be anything, and explore your identity however you\u2019d like. Want to be an alien? A talking dog? A sentient shoe with glowing bits that react to the beat of music by changing color? \nI mean, sure, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re about.\nCome on in -- hundreds of thousands of worlds (and a whole bunch of new friends!) are waiting for you.",

The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey.\n \nThe Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play.\nMore information about the game is available at \nhttp://www.deadbydaylight.com\nKey Features\n\u2022\t\nSurvive Together\u2026 Or Not\n - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground?\n\u2022\t\nWhere Am I?\n - Each level is procedurally generated, so you\u2019ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play.\n\u2022\t\nA Feast for Killers\n - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer\u2019s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims.\n\u2022\t\nDeeper and Deeper\n - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer.\n\u2022\t\nReal People, Real Fear\n - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it\u2019s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what\u2019s hiding in the fog.\nWARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY/EPILEPSY SEIZURES - READ THIS NOTICE BEFORE PLAYING\nA very small percentage of people may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain kinds of flashing lights or light patterns.
